# 2025 March Madness Forecast

This repository contains the code for fitting a dynamic Bayesian model of NCAA team performance and simulating potential March Madness outcomes based on the results. The model is written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and the core pipeline is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), with some modest [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as needed.

READMEs in each directory provide details on the directory contents. In particular, the [stan/](stan/) README walks through the model in detail. A general overview of the model methodology can be found in the [*How this works*](https://www.thedatadiary.net/posts/2025-03-16-march-madness/) article, and the full output for the [men's](https://www.thedatadiary.net/projects/2025-march-madness/mens) and [women's](https://www.thedatadiary.net/projects/2025-march-madness/womens) brackets can be found at [the data diary](https://www.thedatadiary.net/).
